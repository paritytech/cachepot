## Introduction

`cachepot` is a fork of `sccache`.

The purpose of this fork is to introduce advanced security concepts to avoid certain attack scenarios as well
as preventing bitrot.

It will focus on the _distributed_ compile cache mode, but will also support the current client only mode.

## Scope

The scope of this document is to explain the status quo, define security goals and will
eventually exist as the reference documentation, once major milestones are achieved.
